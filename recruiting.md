# Recruiting for Geometry and Topology at MSU

There are several faculty between the School of Computing and the Department of
Mathematical Sciences at MSU that conduct research in geometry and topology.
Below is a bio for each. If you choose to study here, you will have no shortage
of fellow classmates and faculty members interested in discussing topology and
geometry!  Between the two departments, we offer several degrees: PhD in
Computer Science or Mathematics, and MS in Computer Science, Data Science, or
Mathematics.

For more information on the CS and Mathematics programs MSU (including admission
requirements and how to apply), see the respective websites:

* [CS](https://www.cs.montana.edu/future_students.html)
* [Math & Data Science](https://math.montana.edu/grad_students/math_graduate_studies.html)

Although we accept applications on a rolling basis, please apply by December
15th (for the math programs) or by January 15th (for the CS programs) in order
to have priority consideration for scholarships and invitations to our
recruitment events (although, they are likely to be virtual this year ...)

If you are interested in applying or have any questions, please feel free to
contact:

* Brittany Fasy <brittany.fasy@montana.edu>
* David Millman <david.millman@montana.edu>


Hope to see you here in Fall 2021!

## About MSU

MSU is nestled in the Rocky Mountains of Southwest Montana. In addition to
providing access to an extraordinary ecosystem for teaching and research
programs, Bozeman is renowned for year-round recreational and cultural
opportunities that include access to world class ski areas, multiple blue ribbon
trout streams, and the Gallatin National Forest.  If you are an outdoors person,
you will love Bozeman.


## Faculty Bios


**Dr. David AYALA** is an associate professor in the Mathematics Department.  He
joined MSU in 2014, after postdocs as Berkeley, USC, Harvard, and the University
of Copenhagen.  He received his PhD in 2009 through Stanford University, under
the direction of Ralph Cohen, in the subject of algebraic topology.  His
research interests are framed by mathematical aspects of quantum physics,
notably as it draws from homotopy theory, manifold topology, and higher category
theory.  Most recently, his work uses stratifications to codify inductive
constructions and argumentation.

**Dr. Brittany FASY** is an assistant professor in the Gianforte School of Computing
and Department of Mathematical Sciences. She joined MSU in 2015, after postdocs
at Tulane University and Carnegie Mellon University. She received her PhD from
Duke Universtiy in 2012, where her adviser was Herbert Edelsbrunner.  Dr. Fasy's
research is in Applied Algebraic Topology, working both on the theoretical
foundations as well as on applying topological techniques to various fields,
including road network analysis and prostate cancer histology. She currently
serves on the steering committee for Women in Computational Topology
(WinCompTop) and is an associate editor of the AIMS journal Foundations of Data
Science.

**Dr. Tomas GEDEON** is a professor of mathematics in the Department of Mathematical
Sciences. He joined MSU in 1995 after a postdoc at Northwestern University. He
received his PhD in 1994 under the direction of Konstantin Mischaikow. His
research interests are in Mathematical Biology and Applied Algebraic Topology.
He is particularly interested in dynamics of large gene networks and
applications of TDA and other data analysis techniques to biological data.

**Dr. Ryan GRADY** is an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematical
Sciences. He obtained his PhD from the University of Notre Dame under Stephan
Stolz, before being a postdoctoral researcher at Boston University and the
Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. His research interests include
algebraic topology and mathematical aspects of quantum field theory.

**Dr. Sam GUNNINGHAM** will be starting as an assistant professor in the Department
of Mathematical Sciences in 2021. He obtained his PhD from Northwestern
University in 2013, and has held postdoctoral positions at the University of
Texas, Austin, the University of Edinburgh, and King's College, London. His
research centers broadly around geometric representation theory, using ideas and
tools from mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and low
dimensional topology.

**Dr. David MILLMAN** is an assistant professor in the Gianforte School of
Computing. He joined MSU in 2017 after helping to build the initial versions of
ProductionPro and Nowsta. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UNC
Chapel Hill in 2012 under the guidance of Jack Snoeyink. Dr. Millman's research
is in Computational Geometry and Scientific Computing and some of their unusual
applications.

**Dr. Binhai ZHU** is a professor in the Gianforte School of Computing.
He joined MSU in 2000, prior to that he taught at City University of
Hong Kong from 1996 to 2000 and did a post-doc at Los Alamos National
Laboratory from 1994 to 1996. He obtained his PhD at McGill University
in 1994 under the supervision of Godfried Toussaint. His current research
interests are algorithms and their applications (especially problems in
computational biology, with algorithms, geometry and topology as tools).

**Dr. Dominique ZOSSO** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical
Sciences.  He is interested in a broad variety of topics in data science, image
analysis, and computational mathematics. Before joining MSU, he earned both an
MSc. and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland,
and spent more than 4 years as Assistant Adjunct Professor in Computational and
Applied Mathematics at UCLA.  His research projects range from very applied to
somewhat theoretical.  For example, he has active collaborations with faculty in
the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering, and the Department of Physics.  On the more theoretical
end of the spectrum, he focuses on efficient optimization techniques and tricks
to make models like Archetypal Analysis applicable to "Big Data" sets. Another
current major research effort is studying "Graph-based Geometric Data Analysis"
that studies the shape of point clouds using notions of convex and integral
geometry.
