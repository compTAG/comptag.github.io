- title: Shape Reconstruction
  image: assets/projects/reconstructon.jpg
  description: >
    In this project we are extending work on reconstructing shapes using
    persistence diagrams. We are currently working on extending our results
    from our paper "Learning Simplicial Complexes from Persistence Diagrams"
    that was published at CCCG18.

- title: Analyzing Data on Road Networks
  image: assets/projects/bike.jpg
  description: >
    In this project we use topological features of data collected on roads
    and maps to learn about how people move in different infrastructures.
    We also use this information to see if the current infrastructure is
    well designed or otherwise. This work is often done in collaboration
    with Dr. Carola Wenk at Tulane University.

- title: Searching in the Space of Persistence Diagrams
  image: assets/projects/hierarchical.jpg
  description: >
    Persistence diagrams are important tools in the field of topological
    data analysis that describe the presence and magnitude of features in a
    filtered topological space. In this research project, we apply concepts
    from locality-sensitive hashing to support approximate nearest neighbor
    search in the space of persistence diagrams.

- title: Statistics and Topology
  image: assets/projects/topologyandstat.jpg
  description: >
    The tools of topological data analysis (TDA), such as persistence
    diagrams, provide new descriptors of data sets, with the potential to
    uncover new insights into data. In our research at the intersection of
    topology and statistics, we define new topological descriptors, and
    prove statistical properties of these descriptors.

- title: Minimum Homotopy
  image: assets/projects/homotopy.png
  description: >
    Finding the minimum area swept out by continuously deforming a closed
    curve in the plane to a point is an area of active research. One
    application is measuring the similarity between two sets of GPS
    coordinates. We use properties of the curves to develop efficient
    algorithms to find the minimum homotopy area.

- title: Constrained Facility Location
  image: assets/projects/cropped_segment.png
  description: >
    Facility location is a traditional geometric optimization problem, the
    objective being optimizing certain geometric criteria to build optimal
    (or sub-optimal) locations for the facilities. In many modern
    applications, significant constraints could be placed on the
    facilities (e.g., a noisy facility should be far away from the
    residential areas).

- title: Gleason QuBBD Project
  image: assets/projects/gleason.png
  description: >
    The long-term goal of this project is to develop quantitative
    methodology for detecting geometric and topological features in point
    clouds extracted from histology images. Of particular relevance, this
    project considers the setting of prostate cancer classification, which
    is based on a pathologist grading of histology slides using the Gleason
    grading system.

- title: BRaiD
  image: assets/projects/avatar.png
  description: >
    Biofilms Resources and Information Database (BRaID) is a centralized
    database and analysis tool for the diverse types of biofilm-related
    data such as metagenomics, images, and trajectories. BRaID will give
    biofilm researchers easier access to large amounts of data and
    analytical tools.

- title: R Package TDA
  image: assets/projects/RTDA.png
  description: >
    The TDA package in R is an important tool for the implementation of key
    functions used in topological data analysis. We are working to simplify
    use of the package and enhance its viability in the future by improving
    and expanding upon its documentation.
